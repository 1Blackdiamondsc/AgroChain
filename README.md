# AgriChain

An Agricultural Supply Chain tracks a farm product from the farmer to the consumer. Farmers in developing countries are heavily dependent on bank loans.
Due to this heavy debt , farmers can't maintain a steady production of agriculture. Micro-finance can help these farmers out of debt.
